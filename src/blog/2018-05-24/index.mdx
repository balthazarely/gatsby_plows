From demoing our latest version of PlowOps at the New Product Showcase to inviting dozens of new agencies to become trial partners, we loved sharing best practices to help you improve safety and efficiency during winter operations at the 2018 APWA Snow Conference!

Many regions of the country experienced large snow events during this past snow season. For this reason, industry attitude toward digitizing and improving winter operations has truly grown from “nice to have” to “must have.”

Conference-goers unanimously agreed that PlowOps provides tremendous improvements in operational efficiency and safety at very low cost.

While a majority of return on investment will come from winter operations, fleet managers are excited to use PlowOps features and functionality year round.

At our booth, we received a lot of questions about landscaping applications, from tree trimming to leaf collection, as well as road maintenance applications like manhole covers and sign maintenance. We’re happy to say that PlowOps is now more flexible and can support you outside of the winter season for these other types of operations!

A big thanks to all the agencies that signed up for our PlowOps 30 Day Free Trial. We’re looking forward to helping you become modern snow fighters!

And, oh yeah, congrats to our RTIC cooler winner, Ben Glantz, from The City of Lincoln, Nebraska! (pictured above)

On the NeoTreks team, we’re outdoorsmen at heart. And we can’t get enough of these coolers that are built for finding comfort well outside your comfort zone.

See you next year!
