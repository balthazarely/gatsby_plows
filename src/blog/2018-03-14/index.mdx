Nestled in the hub of Central New Jersey, Montgomery Township serves over 22,000 residents, a number that has steadily increased year over year. Facing rapid growth, the Dept. of Public Works brought in PlowOps to help manage more than 50 plows across a mix of urban and suburban neighborhoods, as well as tricky rural roads.

Montgomery Township successfully digitized winter operations to keep up with a fleet comprised of both employees and contract drivers. A low-cost mobile solution that improves the safety and efficiency of snow-plowing operations, PlowOps brought together this disparate fleet as a unified team to tackle inclement weather and snowstorms common in the area. New Jersey even experienced a recent bomb cyclone that caused a state of emergency across the Eastern seaboard.

By using technology to manage snow-plowing operations for the very first time, Montgomery Township has realized the time and cost savings of more efficient processes—without having to purchase and maintain costly hardware and software.

“Montgomery Township has been a great partner for us,” commented Austin Mulder, VP of Product Development at NeoTreks. “Art and his team have provided excellent feedback, which has enabled us to make PlowOps an even better product.”

The thought of adopting a new technology where there was none before can seem like a daunting task at first, but the hands-on support from the PlowOps team can help make the transition easy and painless.
