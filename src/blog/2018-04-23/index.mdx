The 2018 American Public Works Association (APWA) Snow Conference has it all — from expert-led snow and ice education sessions to an exhibit floor full of the latest must-have winter operation solutions you’ve been looking for. So join your peers and meet us in Indianapolis May 6–9, 2018 to take advantage of everything this year’s conference has to offer.

Our most productive clients know that springtime is the perfect time to start planning to improve safety and efficiency with PlowOps next winter.

We’ll be demoing our latest version of PlowOps at the APWA New Product Showcase on Monday, May 7th at 10am/central and sharing best practices to help professionals like you improve safety and efficiency during winter operations in your community.

Plus, we’re offering a free 30-day trial of PlowOps for you to try this new product and help prepare for your winter operations next fall!

“Many regions of the country experienced large snow events during this past snow season, and we are pleased to offer PlowOps free of charge for a 30-day trial to help organizations plan and improve their plowing operations for the coming snow events next season,” said Michael E. Bullock, president and CEO at NeoTreks, Inc.

PlowOps provides tremendous improvements in operational efficiency and safety at very low cost — using the smart devices that plow operators already use without hardware infrastructure costs.
